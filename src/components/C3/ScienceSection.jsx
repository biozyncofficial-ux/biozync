            Traditional C3 trees lose significant carbon through photorespiration, especially under heat and drought. 
            C3 Super Trees are enhanced to redirect those losses into glucose, reducing waste and increasing net COâ‚‚ assimilation.

            This is achieved without a full photosynthetic overhaul, keeping trees ecologically balanced and fast to deploy.
